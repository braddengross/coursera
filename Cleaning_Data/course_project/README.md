The provided code can run on the corresponding dataset to combine the test and training data, extract only the
columns pertaining to mean and standard deviation, turn this into a tidy data set, and write the final
data set into a file called "run_analysis.txt".  The data would need to be downloaded and unzipped into a folder
called data in your working directory.

Data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The script to run is called run_analysis.  It requires no input from the user aside from correctly downloading
and saving the data.
